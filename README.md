# Project 3: Spots

### Overview  

Spots was designed with the goal of connecting you to your friends and family, no matter the date or time. Users are able to post photos as well as keep their profiles up to date, all on one page, from their phone or their desktop computer!
  
**Intro**
  
This project was designed with user screen size in mind, and will adjust itself accordingly. Elements are placed using the grid function, and will align themselve within a specific column structure depending on screen size. The buttons do fun things when you hover over them!
